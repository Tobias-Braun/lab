## How to Set Up iTerm2

#### 1. Enable Natural Text Navigation (move/delete by words)

To get “normal” text navigation (e.g. `⌥←`, `⌥→`, `⌥⌫` to move/delete by words), enable _Natural Text Editing_ in iTerm2:

1. Open **iTerm2**.
2. In the menu bar, go to **iTerm2 → Settings…**
   > ⚠️ Not **Preferences… → Keys** – you need **Profiles → Keys**.
3. Select the **Profiles** tab.
4. Choose your profile (usually **Default**).
5. Go to the **Keys** tab (may be called **Key Mappings** in older versions).
6. Click the **Presets…** dropdown at the bottom.
7. Select **Natural Text Editing**.

This will configure common shortcuts so that navigation and deletion by words behaves more like typical text editors and terminals.
